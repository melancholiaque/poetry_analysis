to him gave,\r\nThat greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,\r\nTo winne him worship, and her grace to have,\r\nWhich of all earthly things he most did crave;\r\nAnd ever as he rode, his hart did earne\r\nTo prove his puissance in battell brave\r\nUpon his foe, and his new force to learne;\r\nUpon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.\r\n\r\niv\r\nA lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,\r\nUpon a lowly Asse more white then snow,\r\nYet she much whiter, but the same did hide\r\nUnder a vele, that wimpled was full low,\r\nAnd over all a blacke stole she did throw,\r\nAs one that inly mournd: so was she sad,\r\nAnd heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;\r\nSeemed in heart some hidden care she had,\r\nAnd by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.\r\n\r\nv\r\nSo pure an innocent, as that same lambe,\r\nShe was in life and every vertuous lore,\r\nAnd by descent from Royall lynage came\r\nOf ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore\r\nTheir scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,\r\nAnd all the world in their subjection held;\r\nTill that infernall feend with foule uprore\r\nForwasted all their land, and them expeld:\r\nWhom to avenge, she had this

Christall streame did gently play,\r\nWhich from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.\r\n\r\nxxxv\r\nArrived there, the little house they fill,\r\nNe looke for entertainement, where none was:\r\nRest is their feast, and all things at their will;\r\nThe noblest mind the best contentment has.\r\nWith faire discourse the evening so they pas:\r\nFor that old man of pleasing wordes had store,\r\nAnd well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;\r\nHe told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore\r\nHe strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.\r\n\r\nxxxvi\r\nThe drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,\r\nAnd the sad humour loading their eye liddes,\r\nAs messenger of Morpheus on them cast\r\nSweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.\r\nUnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:\r\nWhere when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,\r\nHe to his study goes, and there amiddes\r\nHis Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,\r\nHe seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.\r\n\r\nxxxvii\r\nThen choosing out few wordes most horrible,\r\n(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,\r\nWith which and other spelles like terrible,\r\nHe bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,\r\nAnd cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame\r\nOf highest God, the Lord of life and light;\r\nA bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name\r\nGreat Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,\r\nAt which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.\r\n\r\nxxxviii\r\nAnd forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred\r\nLegions of Sprights, the which like little flyes\r\nFluttring about his ever damned hed,\r\nA-waite whereto their service he applyes,\r\nTo aide his friends, or fray his enimies:\r\nOf those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,\r\nAnd fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;\r\nThe one of them he gave a message too,\r\nThe other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.\r\n\r\nxxxix\r\nHe making speedy way through spersed ayre,\r\nAnd through the world of waters wide and peepe,\r\nTo Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.\r\nAmid the bowels of the earth full steepe,\r\nAnd low, where dawning day doth never peepe,\r\nHis dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed\r\nDoth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe\r\nIn silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,\r\nWhiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.\r\n\r\nxl\r\nWhose double gates he findeth locked fast,\r\nThe one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,\r\nThe other all with silver overcast;\r\nAnd wakefull dogges before them farre do lye\r\nWatching to banish Care their enimy,\r\nWho oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.\r\nBy them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,\r\nAnd unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe\r\nIn drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.\r\n\r\nxli\r\nAnd more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,\r\nA trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe\r\nAnd ever-drizling raine upon the loft,\r\nMixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne\r\nOf swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:\r\nNo other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,\r\nAs still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,\r\nMight there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,\r\nWrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.\r\n\r\nxlii\r\nThe messenger approching to him spake,\r\nBut his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:\r\nSo sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.\r\nThen rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,\r\nWhereat he gan to stretch: but he againe\r\nShooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.\r\nAs one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine\r\nIn tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,\r\nHe mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.\r\n\r\nxliii\r\nThe Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,\r\nAnd threatned unto him the dreaded name\r\nOf Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,\r\nAnd lifting up his lumpish head, with blame\r\nHalfe angry asked him, for what he came.\r\nHither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,\r\nHe that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,\r\nHe bids thee to him send for his intent\r\nA fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.\r\n\r\nxliv\r\nThe God obayde, and calling forth straight way\r\nA diverse dreame out of his prison darke,\r\nDelivered it to him, and downe did lay\r\nHis heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,\r\nWhose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.\r\nHe backe returning by the Yvorie dore,\r\nRemounted up as light as chearefull Larke,\r\nAnd on his litle winges the dreame he bore\r\nIn hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.\r\n\r\nxlv\r\nWho all this while with charmes and hidden artes,\r\nHad made a Lady of that other Spright,\r\nAnd fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes\r\nSo lively, and so like in all mens sight,\r\nThat weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:\r\nThe maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,\r\nWas nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:\r\nHer all in white he clad, and over it\r\nCast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.\r\n\r\nxlvi\r\nNow when that ydle dreame was to him brought,\r\nUnto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,\r\nWhere he slept soundly void of evill thought\r\nAnd with false shewes abuse his fantasy,\r\nIn sort as he him schooled privily:\r\nAnd that new creature borne without her dew,\r\nFull of the makers guile, with usage sly\r\nHe taught to imitate that Lady trew,\r\nWhose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.\r\n\r\nxlvii\r\nThus well instructed, to their worke they hast,\r\nAnd comming where the knight in slomber lay,\r\nThe one upon his hardy head him plast,\r\nAnd made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,\r\nThat nigh his manly hart did melt away,\r\nBathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:\r\nThen seemed him his Lady by him lay,\r\nAnd to him playnd, how that false winged boy,\r\nHer chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.\r\n\r\nxlviii\r\nAnd she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,\r\nFaire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring\r\nHer, whom he waking evermore did weene,\r\nTo be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring\r\nOn earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,\r\nNow a loose Leman to vile service bound:\r\nAnd eke the Graces seemed all to sing,\r\nHymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,\r\nWhile freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.\r\n\r\nxlix\r\nIn this great passion of unwonted lust,\r\nOr wonted feare of doing ought amis,\r\nHe started up, as seeming to mistrust\r\nSome secret ill, or hidden foe of his:\r\nLo there before his face his Lady is,\r\nUnder blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,\r\nAnd as halfe blushing offred him to kis,\r\nWith gentle blandishment and lovely looke,\r\nMost like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.\r\n\r\nl\r\nAll cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight,\r\nAnd halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,\r\nHe thought have slaine her in his fierce despight:\r\nBut hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,\r\nHe stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise\r\nTo prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.\r\nWringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,\r\nTho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth,\r\nBoth for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.\r\n\r\nli\r\nAnd said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,\r\nShall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,\r\nAnd mightie causes wrought in heaven above,\r\nOr the blind God, that doth me thus amate,\r\nFor hoped love to winne me certaine hate?\r\nYet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.\r\nDie is my dew: yet rew my wretched state\r\nYou, whom my hard avenging destinie\r\nHath made judge of my life or death indifferently.\r\n\r\nlii\r\nYour owne deare sake forst me at first to leave\r\nMy Fathers kingdome, There she stopt with teares;\r\nHer swollen hart her speach seemd to bereave,\r\nAnd then againe begun, My weaker yeares\r\nCaptiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,\r\nFly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:\r\nLet me not dye in languor and long teares.\r\nWhy Dame (quoth he) what hath ye thus dismayd?\r\nWhat frayes ye, that were wont to comfort me affrayd?\r\n\r\nliii\r\nLove of your selfe, she said, and deare constraint\r\nLets me not sleepe, but wast the wearie night\r\nIn secret anguish and unpittied plaint,\r\nWhiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight.\r\nHer doubtfull words made that redoubted knight\r\nSuspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,\r\nHer fawning love with foule disdainefull spight\r\nHe would not shend, but said, Deare dame I rew,\r\nThat for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew.\r\n\r\nliv\r\nAssure your selfe, it fell not all to ground;\r\nFor all so deare as life is to my hart,\r\nI deeme your love, and hold me to you bound;\r\nNe let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart,\r\nWhere cause is none, but to your rest depart.\r\nNot all content, yet seemd she to appease\r\nHer mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,\r\nAnd fed with words, that could not chuse but please,\r\nSo slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.\r\n\r\nlv\r\nLong after lay he musing at her mood,\r\nMuch griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,\r\nFor whose defence he was to shed his blood.\r\nAt last dull wearinesse of former fight\r\nHaving yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,\r\nThat troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,\r\nWith bowres, and beds, and

stands\r\nHearing the holy priest that to her speakes\r\nAnd blesseth her with his two happy hands,\r\nHow the red roses flush up in her cheekes,\r\nAnd the pure snow with goodly vermill stayne,\r\nLike crimsin dyde in grayne,\r\nThat even th'Angels which continually,\r\nAbout the sacred Altare doe remaine,\r\nForget their service and about her fly,\r\nOfte peeping in her face that

had man more joyfull day then this,\r\nWhom heaven would heape with blis.\r\nMake feast therefore now all this live long day,\r\nThis day for ever to me holy is,\r\nPoure out the wine without restraint or stay,\r\nPoure not by cups, but by the belly full,\r\nPoure out to all that wull,\r\nAnd sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,\r\nThat they may sweat, and drunken be withall.\r\nCrowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,\r\nAnd Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine,\r\nAnd let the Graces daunce unto the rest;\r\nFor they can doo it best:\r\nThe whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,\r\nTo which the woods shal answer and theyr eccho ring.\r\n\r\nRing ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,\r\nAnd leave your wonted labors for this day:\r\nThis day is holy; doe ye write it downe,\r\nThat ye for ever it remember may.\r\nThis day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,\r\nWith Barnaby the bright,\r\nFrom whence declining daily by degrees,\r\nHe somewhat loseth of his heat and light,\r\nWhen once the Crab behind his back he sees.\r\nBut for this time it ill ordained was,\r\nTo chose the longest day in all the yeare,\r\nAnd shortest night, when longest fitter weare:\r\nYet never day so long, but late would passe.\r\nRing ye the bels, to make it weare away,\r\nAnd bonefiers make all day,\r\nAnd daunce about them, and about them sing:\r\nThat all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.\r\n\r\nAh when will this long weary day have end,\r\nAnd lende me leave to come unto my love?\r\nHow slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?\r\nHow slowly does sad Time his feathers move?\r\nHast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home\r\nWithin the Westerne fome:\r\nThy tyred steedes long since have need of rest.\r\nLong though it be, at last I see it gloome,\r\nAnd the bright evening star with golden creast\r\nAppeare out of the East.\r\nFayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of love\r\nThat all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,\r\nAnd guydest lovers through the nightes dread,\r\nHow chearefully thou lookest from above,\r\nAnd seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light\r\nAs joying in the sight\r\nOf these glad many which for joy doe sing,\r\nThat all the woods them answer and their echo ring.\r\n\r\nNow ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast;\r\nEnough is it, that all the day was youres:\r\nNow day is doen, and night is nighing fast:\r\nNow bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.\r\nNow night is come, now soone her disaray,\r\nAnd in her bed her lay;\r\nLay her in lillies and in violets,\r\nAnd silken courteins over her display,\r\nAnd odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets.\r\nBehold how goodly my faire love does ly\r\nIn proud humility;\r\nLike unto Maia, when as Jove her tooke,\r\nIn Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,\r\nTwixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,\r\nWith bathing in the Acidalian brooke.\r\nNow it is night, ye damsels may be gon,\r\nAnd leave my love alone,\r\nAnd leave likewise your former lay to sing:\r\nThe woods no more shal answere, nor your echo ring.\r\n\r\nNow welcome night, thou night so long expected,\r\nThat long daies labour doest at last defray,\r\nAnd all my cares, which cruell love collected,\r\nHast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:\r\nSpread thy broad wing over my love and me,\r\nThat no man may us see,\r\nAnd in thy sable mantle us enwrap,\r\nFrom feare of perrill and foule horror free.\r\nLet no false treason seeke us to entrap,\r\nNor any dread disquiet once annoy\r\nThe safety of our joy:\r\nBut let the night be calme and quietsome,\r\nWithout tempestuous storms or sad afray:\r\nLyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,\r\nWhen he begot the great Tirynthian groome:\r\nOr lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie,\r\nAnd begot Majesty.\r\nAnd let the mayds and yongmen cease to sing:\r\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\r\n\r\nLet no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,\r\nBe heard all night within nor yet without:\r\nNe let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,\r\nBreake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout.\r\nLet no deluding dreames, nor dreadful sights\r\nMake sudden sad affrights;\r\nNe let housefyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,\r\nNe let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,\r\nNe let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,\r\nNe let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,\r\nFray us with things that be not.\r\nLet not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard:\r\nNor the night Raven that still deadly yels,\r\nNor damned ghosts cald up with mighty spels,\r\nNor griesly vultures make us once affeard:\r\nNe let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking\r\nMake us to wish theyr choking.\r\nLet none of these theyr drery accents sing;\r\nNe let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\r\n\r\nBut let stil Silence trew night watches keepe,\r\nThat sacred peace may in assurance rayne,\r\nAnd tymely sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,\r\nMay poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne,\r\nThe whiles an hundred little winged loves,\r\nLike divers fethered doves,\r\nShall fly and flutter round about your bed,\r\nAnd in the secret darke, that none reproves,\r\nTheir prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal spread\r\nTo filch away sweet snatches of delight,\r\nConceald through covert night.\r\nYe sonnes of Venus, play your sports at will,\r\nFor greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes,\r\nThinks more upon her paradise of joyes,\r\nThen what ye do, albe it good or ill.\r\nAll night therefore attend your merry play,\r\nFor it will soone be day:\r\nNow none doth hinder you, that say or sing,\r\nNe will the woods now answer, nor your Eccho ring.\r\n\r\nWho is the same, which at my window peepes?\r\nOr whose is that faire face, that shines so bright,\r\nIs it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes,\r\nBut walkes about high heaven al the night?\r\nO fayrest goddesse, do thou not envy\r\nMy love with me to spy:\r\nFor thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,\r\nAnd for a fleece of woll, which privily,\r\nThe Latmian shephard once unto thee brought,\r\nHis pleasures with thee wrought.\r\nTherefore to us be favorable now;\r\nAnd sith of wemens labours thou hast charge,\r\nAnd generation goodly dost enlarge,\r\nEncline thy will t'effect our wishfull vow,\r\nAnd the chast wombe informe with timely seed,\r\nThat may our comfort breed:\r\nTill which we cease our hopefull hap to sing,\r\nNe let the woods us answere, nor our Eccho ring.\r\n\r\nAnd thou great Juno, which with awful might\r\nThe lawes of wedlock still dost patronize,\r\nAnd the religion of the faith first plight\r\nWith sacred rites hast taught to solemnize:\r\nAnd eeke for comfort often called art\r\nOf women in their smart,\r\nEternally bind thou this lovely band,\r\nAnd all thy blessings unto us impart.\r\nAnd thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand,\r\nThe bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,\r\nWithout blemish or staine,\r\nAnd the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight\r\nWith secret ayde doest succour and supply,\r\nTill they bring forth the fruitfull progeny,\r\nSend us the timely fruit of this same night.\r\nAnd thou fayre Hebe, and thou Hymen free,\r\nGrant that it may so be.\r\nTil which we cease your further prayse to sing,\r\nNe any woods shal answer, nor your Eccho ring.\r\n\r\nAnd ye high heavens, the temple of the gods,\r\nIn which a thousand torches flaming bright\r\nDoe burne, that to us wretched earthly clods,\r\nIn dreadful darknesse lend desired light;\r\nAnd all ye powers which in the same remayne,\r\nMore then we men can fayne,\r\nPoure out your blessing on us plentiously,\r\nAnd happy influence upon us raine,\r\nThat we may raise a large posterity,\r\nWhich from the earth, which they may long possesse,\r\nWith lasting happinesse,\r\nUp to your haughty pallaces may mount,\r\nAnd for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit\r\nMay heavenly tabernacles there inherit,\r\nOf blessed Saints for to increase the

ornaments,\r\nWith which my love should duly have bene dect,\r\nWhich cutting off through hasty accidents,\r\nYe would not stay your dew time to expect,\r\nBut promist both to recompens,\r\nBe unto

Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,\r\nIn view and opposite two cities stood,\r\nSea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;\r\nThe one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.\r\nAt Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,\r\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\r\nAnd offer'd as a dower his burning throne,\r\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\r\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\r\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\r\nHer wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,\r\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\r\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\r\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\r\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\r\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\r\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\r\nFrom whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;\r\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\r\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\r\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\r\nWhen 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\r\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\r\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\r\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\r\nWhich lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.\r\nShe ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind\r\nWould burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,\r\nOr warm or cool them, for they took delight\r\nTo play upon those hands, they were so white.\r\nBuskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,\r\nAnd branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;\r\nWhere sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,\r\nSuch as the world would wonder to behold:\r\nThose with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,\r\nWhich as she went, would chirrup through the bills.\r\nSome say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,\r\nAnd looking in her face, was strooken blind.\r\nBut this is true; so like was one the other,\r\nAs he imagin'd Hero was his mother;\r\nAnd oftentimes into her bosom flew,\r\nAbout her naked neck his bare arms threw,\r\nAnd laid his childish head upon her breast,\r\nAnd with still panting rock'd there took his rest.\r\nSo lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,\r\nAs Nature wept, thinking she was undone,\r\nBecause she took more from her than she left,\r\nAnd of such wondrous beauty her bereft:\r\nTherefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,\r\nSince Hero's time hath half the world been black.\r\n\r\n         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young\r\n(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),\r\nDwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none\r\nFor whom succeeding times make greater moan.\r\nHis dangling tresses, that were never shorn,\r\nHad they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,\r\nWould have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece\r\nTo hazard more than for the golden fleece.\r\nFair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;\r\nGrief makes her pale, because she moves not there.\r\nHis body was as straight as Circe's wand;\r\nJove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.\r\nEven as delicious meat is to the taste,\r\nSo was his neck in touching, and surpast\r\nThe white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,\r\nHow smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\r\nAnd whose immortal fingers did imprint\r\nThat heavenly path with many a curious dint\r\nThat runs along his back; but my rude pen\r\nCan hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\r\nMuch less of powerful gods: let it suffice\r\nThat my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;\r\nThose orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his\r\nThat leapt into the water for a kiss\r\nOf his own shadow, and, despising many,\r\nDied ere he could enjoy the love of any.\r\nHad wild Hippolytus Leander seen,\r\nEnamour'd of his beauty had he been.\r\nHis presence made the rudest peasant melt,\r\nThat in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\r\nThe barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,\r\nWas mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.\r\nSome swore he was a maid in man's attire,\r\nFor in his looks were all that men desire,\r\nA pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\r\nA brow for love to banquet royally;\r\nAnd such as knew he was a man, would say,\r\n\"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\r\nWhy art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?\r\nThough thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\"\r\n\r\n         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,\r\nFor his sake whom their goddess held so dear,\r\nRose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.\r\nThither resorted many a wandering guest\r\nTo meet their loves; such as had none at all\r\nCame lovers home from this great festival;\r\nFor every street, like to a firmament,\r\nGlister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,\r\nFrighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd\r\nEternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd\r\nAs if another Pha{\"e}ton had got\r\nThe guidance of the sun's rich chariot.\r\nBut far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,\r\nAnd stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;\r\nFor like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,\r\nSo was her beauty to the standers-by;\r\nNor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star\r\n(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car\r\nFrom Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,\r\nWhere, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,\r\nShe proudly sits) more over-rules the flood\r\nThan she the hearts of those that near her stood.\r\nEven as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,\r\nWretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,\r\nIncens'd with savage heat, gallop amain\r\nFrom steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,\r\nSo ran the people forth to gaze upon her,\r\nAnd all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.\r\nAnd as in fury of a dreadful fight,\r\nTheir fellows being slain or put to flight,\r\nPoor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,\r\nSo at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,\r\nAwait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\r\nHe whom she favours lives; the other dies.\r\nThere might you see one sigh, another rage,\r\nAnd some, their violent passions to assuage,\r\nCompile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,\r\nFor faithful love will never turn to hate.\r\nAnd many, seeing great princes were denied,\r\nPin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.\r\nOn this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!\r\nWent Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower\r\nTo Venus' temple, where unhappily,\r\nAs after chanc'd, they did each other spy.\r\nSo fair a church as this had Venus none:\r\nThe walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,\r\nWherein was Proteus carved; and over-head\r\nA lively vine of green sea-agate spread,\r\nWhere by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,\r\nAnd with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.\r\nOf crystal shining fair the pavement was;\r\nThe town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:\r\nThere might you see the gods in sundry shapes,\r\nCommitting heady riots, incest, rapes:\r\nFor know, that underneath this radiant flower\r\nWas Danae's statue in a brazen tower,\r\nJove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,\r\nTo dally with Idalian Ganimed,\r\nAnd for his love Europa bellowing loud,\r\nAnd tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;\r\nBlood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,\r\nWhich limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;\r\nLove kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,\r\nSylvanus weeping for the lovely boy\r\nThat now is turn'd into a cypress tree,\r\nUnder whose shade the wood-gods love to be.\r\nAnd in the midst a silver altar stood:\r\nThere Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,\r\nVail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;\r\nAnd modestly they opened as she rose.\r\nThence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;\r\nAnd thus Leander was enamoured.\r\nStone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,\r\nTill with the fire that from his count'nance blazed\r\nRelenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:\r\nSuch force and virtue hath an amorous look.\r\n\r\n         It lies not in our power to love or hate,\r\nFor will in us is over-rul'd by fate.\r\nWhen two are stript, long ere the course begin,\r\nWe wish that one should lose, the other win;\r\nAnd one especially do we affect\r\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\r\nThe reason no man knows, let it suffice,\r\nWhat we behold is censur'd by our eyes.\r\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\r\nWho ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?", "name": "Hero and Leander", "age": "Renaissance", "poet": 10}}, {"model":

zealous disposition\r\nTo God, and so to his religion.\r\nThere must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,\r\nSuch as no carpers may contrare reveal;\r\nFor each thing feigned ought more wary be.\r\nThere thou must walk in sober gravity,\r\nAnd seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:\r\nFast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,\r\nAnd unto every one do courtesy meek:\r\nThese looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,\r\nBut be thou sure one not to lack or long.\r\nAnd if thee list unto the court to throng,\r\nAnd there to hunt after the hoped prey,\r\nThen must thou thee dispose another

mock.\r\nSo may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,\r\nUnless thou canst one conjure by device,\r\nOr cast a figure for a bishopric;\r\nAnd if one could, it were but a school trick.\r\nThese be the ways by which without reward\r\nLivings in court be gotten, though full hard;\r\nFor nothing there is done without a fee:\r\nThe courtier needs must recompensed be\r\nWith a benevolence, or have in

away\r\nLike empty shadows, did afflict my brain,\r\nWalked forth to ease my pain\r\nAlong the shore of silver streaming Thames,\r\nWhose rutty bank, the which his river hems,\r\nWas painted all with variable flowers,\r\nAnd all the meads adorned with dainty gems,\r\nFit to deck maidens' bowers,\r\nAnd crown their paramours,\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nThere, in a meadow, by the river's side,\r\nA flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,\r\nAll lovely daughters of the flood thereby,\r\nWith goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,\r\nAs each had been a bride;\r\nAnd each one had a little wicker basket,\r\nMade of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,\r\nIn which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,\r\nAnd with fine fingers cropt full featously\r\nThe tender stalks on high.\r\nOf every sort, which in that meadow grew,\r\nThey gathered some; the violet pallid blue,\r\nThe little daisy, that at evening closes,\r\nThe virgin lily, and the primrose true,\r\nWith store of vermeil roses,\r\nTo deck their bridegrooms' posies\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nWith that, I saw two swans of goodly hue\r\nCome softly swimming down along the Lee;\r\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see.\r\nThe snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,\r\nDid never whiter shew,\r\nNor Jove himself, when he a swan would be\r\nFor love of Leda, whiter did appear:\r\nYet Leda was they say as white as he,\r\nYet not so white as these, nor nothing near.\r\nSo purely white they were,\r\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\r\nSeemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare\r\nTo wet their silken feathers, lest they might\r\nSoil their fair plumes with water not so fair,\r\nAnd mar their beauties bright,\r\nThat shone as heaven's light,\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nEftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,\r\nRan all in haste, to see that silver brood,\r\nAs they came floating on the crystal flood.\r\nWhom when they saw, they stood amazed still,\r\nTheir wondering eyes to fill.\r\nThem seemed they never saw a sight so fair,\r\nOf fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem\r\nThem heavenly born, or to be that same pair\r\nWhich through the sky draw Venus' silver team;\r\nFor sure they did not seem\r\nTo be begot of any earthly seed,\r\nBut rather angels, or of angels' breed:\r\nYet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,\r\nIn sweetest season, when each flower and weed\r\nThe earth did fresh array,\r\nSo fresh they seemed as day,\r\nEven as their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet

which upon those goodly birds they threw,\r\nAnd all the waves did strew,\r\nThat like old Peneus' waters they did seem,\r\nWhen down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,\r\nScattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,\r\nThat they appear through lilies' plenteous store,\r\nLike a bride's chamber floor.\r\nTwo of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,\r\nOf freshest flowers which in that mead they found,\r\nThe which presenting all in trim array,\r\nTheir snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,\r\nWhilst one did sing this lay,\r\nPrepared against that day,\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\n'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,\r\nAnd heaven's glory, whom this happy hour\r\nDoth lead unto

smile,\r\nWhose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove\r\nAll love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile\r\nFor ever to assoil.\r\nLet endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,\r\nAnd blessed plenty wait upon your board,\r\nAnd let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,\r\nThat fruitful issue may to you afford,\r\nWhich may your foes confound,\r\nAnd make your joys redound\r\nUpon your

day should not be long.\r\nAnd gentle echo from the neighbour ground\r\nTheir accents did resound.\r\nSo forth those joyous birds did pass along,\r\nAdown the Lee, that to them murmured low,\r\nAs he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,\r\nYet did by signs his glad affection show,\r\nMaking his stream run slow.\r\nAnd all the fowl which in his flood did dwell\r\nGan flock about these twain, that did excel\r\nThe rest so far as Cynthia doth shend\r\nThe lesser stars.

Knights to bide,\r\nTill they decayed through pride:\r\nNext whereunto there stands a stately place,\r\nWhere oft I gained gifts and goodly grace\r\nOf that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,\r\nWhose want too well now feels my friendless case.\r\nBut ah, here fits not well\r\nOld woes but joys to tell\r\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nYet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,\r\nGreat England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,\r\nWhose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,\r\nAnd Hercules' two pillars standing near\r\nDid make to quake and fear:\r\nFair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,\r\nThat fillest England with thy triumph's fame,\r\nJoy have thou of thy noble victory,\r\nAnd endless happiness of thine own name\r\nThat promiseth the same:\r\nThat through thy prowess and victorious arms,\r\nThy country may be freed from foreign harms;\r\nAnd great Elisa's glorious name may ring\r\nThrough all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,\r\nWhich some brave Muse may sing\r\nTo ages following,\r\nUpon the bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\r\n\r\nFrom those high towers this noble lord issuing,\r\nLike radiant Hesper when his golden hair\r\nIn th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,\r\nDescended to the river's open

ornaments of nature,\r\nFit for so goodly stature;\r\nThat like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,\r\nWhich deck the baldric of the heavens bright.\r\nThey two forth pacing to the river's side,\r\nReceived those two fair birds, their love's delight;\r\nWhich, at th' appointed tide,\r\nEach one did make his bride\r\nAgainst their bridal day, which is not long:\r\n      Sweet Thames, run

dost thou now inspire\r\nInto my feeble breast, too full of thee?\r\nWhilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,\r\nThou in me kindlest much more great desire,\r\nAnd up aloft above my strength dost raise\r\nThe wondrous matter of my fire to praise.\r\n\r\nThat as I erst in praise of thine own name,\r\nSo now in honour of thy mother dear,\r\nAn honourable hymn I eke should frame,\r\nAnd with the brightness of her beauty clear,\r\nThe ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear\r\nTo admiration of that heavenly light,\r\nFrom whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.\r\n\r\nThereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,\r\nMother of love, and of all world's delight,\r\nWithout whose sovereign grace and kindly duty\r\nNothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,\r\nDo thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light\r\nT' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,\r\nAnd beautify this sacred hymn of thine:\r\n\r\nThat both to thee, to whom I mean it most,\r\nAnd eke to her, whose fair immortal beam\r\nHath darted fire into my feeble ghost,\r\nThat now it wasted is with woes extreme,\r\nIt may so please, that she at length will stream\r\nSome dew of grace into my withered heart,\r\nAfter long sorrow and consuming smart.\r\n\r\nWHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast\r\nTo make all things such as we now behold,\r\nIt seems that he before his eyes had plac'd\r\nA goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould\r\nHe fashion'd them as comely as he could;\r\nThat now so fair and seemly they appear,\r\nAs nought may be amended anywhere.\r\n\r\nThat wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,\r\nWhether in earth laid up in secret store,\r\nOr else in heaven, that no man may it see\r\nWith sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,\r\nIs perfect Beauty, which all men adore;\r\nWhose face and feature doth so much excel\r\nAll mortal sense, that none the same may tell.\r\n\r\nThereof as every earthly thing partakes\r\nOr more or less, by influence divine,\r\nSo it more fair accordingly it makes,\r\nAnd the gross matter of this earthly mine,\r\nWhich clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,\r\nDoing away the dross which dims the light\r\nOf that fair beam which therein is empight.\r\n\r\nFor, through infusion of celestial power,\r\nThe duller earth it quick'neth with delight,\r\nAnd lifeful spirits privily doth pour\r\nThrough all the parts, that to the looker's sight\r\nThey seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,\r\nO Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam\r\nOf thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.\r\n\r\nThat is the thing which giveth pleasant grace\r\nTo all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,\r\nLight of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,\r\nThence to the soul darts amorous desire,\r\nAnd robs the hearts of those which it admire;\r\nTherewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,\r\nThat wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.\r\n\r\nHow vainly then do idle wits invent,\r\nThat beauty is nought else but mixture made\r\nOf colours fair, and goodly temp'rament\r\nOf pure complexions, that shall quickly fade\r\nAnd pass away, like to a summer's shade;\r\nOr that it is but comely composition\r\nOf parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.\r\n\r\nHath white and red in it such wondrous power,\r\nThat it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,\r\nAnd therein stir such rage and restless stour,\r\nAs nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?\r\nOr can proportion of the outward part\r\nMove such affection in the inward mind,\r\nThat it can rob both sense and reason blind?\r\n\r\nWhy do not then the blossoms of the field,\r\nWhich are array'd with much more orient hue,\r\nAnd to the sense most dainty odours yield,\r\nWork like impression in the looker's view?\r\nOr why do not fair pictures like power shew,\r\nIn which oft-times we nature see of art\r\nExcell'd, in perfect limning every part?\r\n\r\nBut ah, believe me, there is more than so,\r\nThat works such wonders in the minds of men;\r\nI, that have often prov'd, too well it know,\r\nAnd whoso list the like assays to ken,\r\nShall find by trial, and confess it then,\r\nThat beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,\r\nAn outward shew of things, that only seem.\r\n\r\nFor that same goodly hue of white and red,\r\nWith which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,\r\nAnd those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread\r\nUpon the lips, shall fade and fall away\r\nTo that they were, even to corrupted clay;\r\nThat golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,\r\nShall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.\r\n\r\nBut that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray\r\nThat light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,\r\nShall never be extinguish'd nor decay;\r\nBut when the vital spirits do expire,\r\nUnto her native planet shall retire;\r\nFor it is heavenly born and cannot die,\r\nBeing a parcel of the purest sky.\r\n\r\nFor when the soul, the which derived was,\r\nAt first, out of that great immortal Spright,\r\nBy whom all live to love, whilom did pass\r\nDown from the top of purest heaven's height\r\nTo be embodied here, it then took light\r\nAnd lively spirits from that fairest star,\r\nWhich lights the world forth from his fiery car.\r\n\r\nWhich power retaining still or more or less,\r\nWhen she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,\r\nThrough every part she doth the same impress,\r\nAccording as the heavens have her graced,\r\nAnd frames her house, in which she will be placed,\r\nFit for herself, adorning it with spoil\r\nOf th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.\r\n\r\nThereof it comes that these fair souls, which have\r\nThe most resemblance of that heavenly light,\r\nFrame to themselves most beautiful and brave\r\nTheir fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,\r\nAnd the gross matter by a sovereign might\r\nTempers so trim, that it may well be seen\r\nA palace fit for such a virgin queen.\r\n\r\nSo every spirit, as it is most pure,\r\nAnd hath in it the more of heavenly light,\r\nSo it the fairer body doth procure\r\nTo habit in, and it more fairly dight\r\nWith cheerful grace and amiable sight.\r\nFor of the soul the body form doth take:\r\nFor soul is form, and doth the body make.\r\n\r\nTherefore wherever that thou dost behold\r\nA comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,\r\nKnow this for certain, that the same doth hold\r\nA beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,\r\nFit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.\r\nFor all that fair is, is by nature good;\r\nThat is a sign to know the gentle blood.\r\n\r\nYet oft it falls that many a gentle mind\r\nDwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,\r\nEither by chance, against the course of kind,\r\nOr through unaptness in the substance found,\r\nWhich it assumed of some stubborn ground,\r\nThat will not yield unto her form's direction,\r\nBut is deform'd with some foul imperfection.\r\n\r\nAnd oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)\r\nThat goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,\r\nIs foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,\r\nWhich doth the world with her delight adorn,\r\nMade but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,\r\nWhilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,\r\nBut every one doth seek but to deprave it.\r\n\r\nYet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,\r\nBut theirs that do abuse it unto ill:\r\nNothing so good, but that through guilty shame\r\nMay be corrupt, and wrested unto will:\r\nNatheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,\r\nHowever flesh{\"e}s fault it filthy make;\r\nFor things immortal no corruption take.\r\n\r\nBut ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments\r\nAnd lively images of heaven's light,\r\nLet not your beams with such disparagements\r\nBe dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;\r\nBut mindful still of your first country's sight,\r\nDo still preserve your first informed grace,\r\nWhose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.\r\n\r\nLoathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,\r\nDisloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,\r\nThat base affections, which your ears would bland,\r\nCommend to you by love's abused name,\r\nBut is indeed the bondslave of defame;\r\nWhich will the garland of your glory mar,\r\nAnd quench the light of your bright shining star.\r\n\r\nBut gentle Love, that loyal is and true,\r\nWill more illumine your resplendent ray,\r\nAnd add more brightness to your goodly hue,\r\nFrom light of his pure fire; which, by like way\r\nKindled of yours, your likeness doth display;\r\nLike as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,\r\nDo both express the face's first impression.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to make your beauty more appear,\r\nIt you behoves to love, and forth to lay\r\nThat heavenly riches which in you ye bear,\r\nThat men the more admire their fountain may;\r\nFor else what booteth that celestial ray,\r\nIf it in darkness be enshrined ever,\r\nThat it of loving eyes be viewed never?\r\n\r\nBut, in your choice of loves, this well advise,\r\nThat likest to yourselves ye them select,\r\nThe which your forms' first source may sympathize,\r\nAnd with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;\r\nFor, if you loosely love without respect,\r\nIt is no love, but a discordant war,\r\nWhose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.\r\n\r\nFor love is a celestial harmony\r\nOf likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,\r\nWhich join together in sweet sympathy,\r\nTo work each other's joy and true content,\r\nWhich they have harbour'd since their first descent\r\nOut of their heavenly bowers, where they did see\r\nAnd know each other here belov'd to be.\r\n\r\nThen wrong it were that any other twain\r\nShould in love's gentle band combined be\r\nBut those whom Heaven did at first ordain,\r\nAnd made out of one mould the more t' agree;\r\nFor all that like the beauty which they see,\r\nStraight do not love; for love is not so light\r\nAs straight to burn at first beholder's sight.\r\n\r\nBut they, which love indeed, look otherwise,\r\nWith pure regard and spotless true intent,\r\nDrawing out of the object of their eyes\r\nA more refined form, which they present\r\nUnto their mind, void of all blemishment;\r\nWhich it reducing to her first perfection,\r\nBeholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.\r\n\r\nAnd then conforming it unto the light,\r\nWhich in itself it hath remaining still,\r\nOf that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,\r\nThereof he fashions in his higher skill\r\nAn heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;\r\nAnd it embracing in his mind entire,\r\nThe mirror of his own thought doth admire.\r\n\r\nWhich seeing now so inly fair to be,\r\nAs outward it appeareth to the eye,\r\nAnd with his spirit's proportion to agree,\r\nHe thereon fixeth all his fantasy,\r\nAnd fully setteth his felicity;\r\nCounting it fairer than it is indeed,\r\nAnd yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.\r\n\r\nFor lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be\r\nThan other men's, and in dear love's delight\r\nSee more than any other eyes can see,\r\nThrough mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,\r\nWhich carry privy message to the spright,\r\nAnd to their eyes that inmost fair display,\r\nAs plain as light discovers dawning day.\r\n\r\nTherein they see, through amorous eye-glances,\r\nArmies of loves still flying to and fro,\r\nWhich dart at them their little fiery lances;\r\nWhom having wounded, back again they go,\r\nCarrying compassion to their lovely foe;\r\nWho, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,\r\nCures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.\r\n\r\nIn which how many wonders do they rede\r\nTo their conceit, that others never see,\r\nNow of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,\r\nLike gods with nectar in their banquets free;\r\nNow of her looks, which like to cordials be;\r\nBut when her words' embassade forth she sends,\r\nLord, how sweet music that unto them lends.\r\n\r\nSometimes upon her forehead they behold\r\nA thousand graces masking in delight;\r\nSometimes within her eyelids they unfold\r\nTen thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight\r\nDo seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;\r\nBut on her lips, like rosy buds in May,\r\nSo many millions of chaste pleasures play.\r\n\r\nAll those, O Cytherea, and thousands more\r\nThy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,\r\nTo deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,\r\nThat may it more to mortal eyes commend,\r\nAnd make it more admir'd of foe and friend:\r\nThat in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,\r\nAnd spread thy lovely kingdom over all.\r\n\r\nThen Io, triumph!

We met his eyes\r\nThat never flinched or turned to compromise,\r\nAnd Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,\r\nKnotted and sailor-like, such as no farm\r\nIn all of Maine could boast of; and away\r\nHe turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...\r\nWe walked on leisurely until a bend\r\nShowed him once more, now working toward the end\r\nOf one great path; wearing his eighty years\r\nLike banners lifted in a wind of cheers.\r\n\r\nThen we turned off abruptlytook the road\r\nCutting the village, the one with the commanding\r\nView of the river. And we strode\r\nMore briskly now to the long pier that showed\r\nWhere the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.\r\nIn the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped\r\nLeisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped\r\nMore on than in the water. Smoothly then\r\nWe shot its nose against the rippling current,\r\nFeeling the rising rivers half-deterrent\r\nPull on the paddle as we turned the blade\r\nTo keep from swerving round; while we delayed\r\nTo watch the curious wave-eaten locks;\r\nOr pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....\r\nBlue eels flew under us, and fishes darted\r\nA thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.\r\nAnd over us the wise and noble-hearted\r\nTwilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,\r\nAnd we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk\r\nDown the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,\r\n\r\nMotionless in the meadows\r\nThe trees, the rocks, the cows...\r\nAnd quiet dripped from the shadows\r\nLike rain from heavy boughs.\r\n\r\nThe tree-toads started ringing\r\nTheir ceaseless silver bells;\r\nA land-locked breeze came swinging\r\nIts censer of earthy smells.\r\n\r\nThe rivers tiny canon\r\nStretched into dusky lands;\r\nLike a dark and silent companion\r\nEvening held out her hands.\r\n\r\nHushed were the dawns bravados;\r\nLoud noon was a silenced cry\r\nAnd quiet slipped from the shadows\r\nAs stars slip out of the sky...\r\n\r\nIt must have been an hour more, or later,\r\nWhen, tramping homeward through the piney wood,\r\nWe felt the years fly back; the brotherhood\r\nOf forests took usand we saw the satyr!\r\nThere in a pool, up to his neck, he stood\r\nAnd grinned to see us stare, incredulous\r\nToo startled to remember fear or flight.\r\nFeeling the menace in the crafty night,\r\nWe turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!\r\nUsing our very names he called. We drew\r\nWith creaking courage down the avenue\r\nOf birches till we saw, with clearing sight,\r\n(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)\r\nFamiliar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,\r\nAnd Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!\r\nThe woods became his background; every tree\r\nSeemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared\r\nThe beauty of that gnarled serenity;\r\nThe quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared\r\nIts shoulders against Time ... And even night\r\nFlowed in and out of him, as though content\r\nWith such a native element;\r\nHappy to move about a spirit quite\r\nAs old, as placid and as confident...\r\nSideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad\r\nHe leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,\r\nHis body in the moonlight dripping stars...\r\n\r\nWe went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.", "name": "Magic", "age": "Modern", "poet": 46}}, {"model": "poetry_app.poem", "pk": 320, "fields": {"content": "Wallace Stevens, A Rabbit as the King of Ghosts from Collected Poems.
